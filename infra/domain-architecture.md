# Infrastructure Domain Architecture

**The cloud-native infrastructure and DevOps automation system that enables reliable, scalable, and secure deployment of the Findly Now microservices ecosystem.**

## Domain Purpose

Transform manual deployment processes to **automated, cloud-native infrastructure as code** with comprehensive CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and security controls.

**Core Value**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures consistent, repeatable deployments across environments while automated CI/CD pipelines enable rapid, safe service delivery with zero-downtime deployments.

## Domain Boundaries

**Bounded Context**: Cloud infrastructure automation and DevOps orchestration
- Kubernetes cluster management and service orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline automation with GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Helm
- Monitoring and observability with Prometheus and Grafana
- Security scanning and compliance automation
- Multi-environment promotion pipelines (dev → staging → production)

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Kubernetes-Native Cloud Architecture

**Decision**: Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the primary container orchestration platform.

**Why**: Kubernetes provides the foundation for cloud-native microservices:
- **Scalability**: Horizontal pod autoscaling based on metrics
- **Reliability**: Self-healing deployments with health checks
- **Portability**: Multi-cloud compatibility and vendor independence
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of tools and operators

**Technology Stack**:
```yaml
# Core Infrastructure
Platform: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Orchestration: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Container_Registry: Google Container Registry (GCR)
Load_Balancing: Google Cloud Load Balancer + Ingress

# Infrastructure as Code
IaC_Tool: Terraform
Package_Manager: Helm
Configuration: Kustomize
Secrets: Google Secret Manager

# CI/CD
Pipeline: GitHub Actions
Security_Scanning: Trivy, Snyk
Quality_Gates: SonarQube
Deployment_Strategy: Blue-Green, Canary
```

### 2. GitOps and Infrastructure as Code

**Decision**: Implement GitOps workflow with all infrastructure defined as code.

**Why**: GitOps provides audit trails, version control, and declarative infrastructure:
- **Version Control**: All infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who changed what and when
- **Rollback**: Easy rollback to previous working configurations
- **Collaboration**: Infrastructure changes reviewed like code

**GitOps Architecture**:
```

    └── disaster-recovery.sh
```

### 3. Multi-Environment Pipeline Strategy

**Decision**: Implement progressive deployment through dev → staging → production environments.

**Why**: Progressive deployment reduces risk and catches issues early:
- **Risk Reduction**: Issues caught in lower environments
- **Validation**: Multiple testing stages before production
- **Confidence**: Gradual rollout builds deployment confidence
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise governance requirements

**Environment Progression**:
```yaml
environments:
  development:
    purpose: "Feature development and integration testing"
    deployment_trigger: "Push to feature branches"
    tests: ["unit", "integration", "smoke"]
    approval_required: false
    auto_cleanup: true
    resource_limits: "minimal"

  staging:
    purpose: "Pre-production validation and performance testing"
    deployment_trigger: "Merge to main branch"
    tests: ["e2e", "performance", "security", "load"]
    approval_required: false
    data: "production-like dataset"
    resource_limits: "production-equivalent"

  production:
    purpose: "Live customer-facing environment"
    deployment_trigger: "Manual promotion from staging"
    tests: ["health checks", "canary validation"]
    approval_required: true
    approvers: ["devops-team", "security-team"]
    deployment_strategy: "blue-green"
    rollback_capability: "automatic"
```

### 4. Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability

**Decision**: Implement full-stack observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing.

**Why**: Microservices require comprehensive monitoring for reliability:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
- **Logs**: Centralized logging with structured JSON logs
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flow visibility
- **Dashboards**: Grafana for visualization and alerting

**Observability Stack**:
```yaml
monitoring_stack:
  metrics:
    collector: "Prometheus"
    storage: "Prometheus TSDB"
    federation: "Multi-cluster setup"
    retention: "30 days"

  visualization:
    dashboard: "Grafana"
    alerting: "Grafana + AlertManager"
    notification_channels: ["slack", "pagerduty", "email"]

  logging:
    aggregation: "Fluent Bit"
    storage: "Google Cloud Logging"
    analysis: "Grafana Loki"
    retention: "90 days"

  tracing:
    collection: "OpenTelemetry"
    backend: "Jaeger"
    sampling_rate: "1% production, 100% staging"

  uptime:
    external_monitoring: "Pingdom"
    synthetic_tests: "Grafana k6"
    sla_tracking: "99.9% uptime target"
```

### 5. Security-First Infrastructure

**Decision**: Implement security controls at every layer with automated scanning and compliance.

**Why**: Security must be built into infrastructure, not bolted on:
- **Shift Left**: Security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Compliance**: Automated compliance checking and reporting
- **Zero Trust**: Network segmentation and least privilege access

**Security Architecture**:
```yaml
security_layers:
  network:
    segmentation: "VPC with private subnets"
    ingress: "Cloud Load Balancer with WAF"
    service_mesh: "Istio for mTLS"
    network_policies: "Kubernetes NetworkPolicy"

  container:
    base_images: "Distroless containers"
    scanning: "Trivy for vulnerability scanning"
    runtime_security: "Falco for runtime monitoring"
    admission_control: "OPA Gatekeeper policies"

  secrets:
    management: "Google Secret Manager"
    rotation: "Automated secret rotation"
    access_control: "RBAC with least privilege"
    encryption: "Envelope encryption at rest"

  identity:
    authentication: "Google Cloud IAM"
    authorization: "Kubernetes RBAC"
    service_accounts: "Workload Identity"
    audit_logging: "GCP Audit Logs"

  compliance:

    policy_enforcement: "OPA policies"
    compliance_reporting: "SOC 2, ISO 27001 alignment"
    incident_response: "Automated breach detection"
```

### 6. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

**Decision**: Implement automated backup, recovery, and multi-region capabilities.

**Why**: Ensure business continuity and meet RTO/RPO requirements:
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated, tested backups of all critical data
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular disaster recovery drills
- **Multi-Region**: Geographic distribution for disaster resilience
- **Automation**: Automated failover and recovery procedures

**Disaster Recovery Strategy**:
```yaml
disaster_recovery:
  rto_target: "15 minutes"  # Recovery Time Objective
  rpo_target: "5 minutes"   # Recovery Point Objective

  backup_strategy:
    databases:
      frequency: "Continuous replication + hourly snapshots"
      retention: "30 days point-in-time recovery"

      testing: "Weekly restore testing"

    application_data:
      frequency: "Real-time replication"
      retention: "90 days"
      versioning: "Enabled"

    infrastructure:
      frequency: "GitOps repository backup"
      retention: "Indefinite"
      versioning: "Git version control"

  multi_region:
    primary_region: "us-central1"
    dr_region: "us-east1"
    replication: "Async replication"
    failover: "Automated DNS failover"

  testing:
    frequency: "Monthly DR drills"
    scope: "Full application stack"
